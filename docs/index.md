## Project layout

    mkdocs.yml    # The configuration file.
    docs/
        index.md  # The documentation homepage.
        ...       # Other markdown pages, images and other files.


## Images:
- Save the image at ./docs/assets/

# `![Image Description](assets/image.jpg)`

We also could call translation to images, in this case we would need to use:

# `![Image Description](assets/image.pt.jpg)`

# `![Image Description](assets/image.en.jpg)`
